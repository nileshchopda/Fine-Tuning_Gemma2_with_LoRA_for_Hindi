# Fine-Tuning Gemma2 with LoRA for Hindi

This repository contains code and documentation for fine-tuning the Gemma2 model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for the Hindi language.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to fine-tune the Gemma2 language model using the LoRA technique to improve its performance on Hindi language tasks. LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adapts pre-trained language models to specific tasks with minimal additional parameters.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nileshchopda/Fine-Tuning_Gemma2_with_LoRA_for_Hindi.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fine-Tuning_Gemma2_with_LoRA_for_Hindi
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To fine-tune the Gemma2 model with LoRA for Hindi, open and run the Jupyter notebook `fine-tuning-gemma-2-with-lora-for-hindi.ipynb` provided in this repository. The notebook contains detailed instructions and code for the fine-tuning process.
